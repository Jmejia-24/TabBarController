## Project Overview

This project is a state-of-the-art iOS application employing a multi-flow and specialized router architecture. Designed to maximize modularity and efficiency in navigation, the app divides its functionality into distinct 'Flows', each with its own 'Router' and set of transitions. This structure not only facilitates scalability and code maintenance but also significantly enhances user experience by providing smooth and contextual navigation.

## Structure and Architecture

The application is organized around the following key components:

### Flows
- **`AppFlow`**: This is the main flow that orchestrates the general navigation of the application. It acts as the traffic director, coordinating among various subordinate flows.
- **`HomeFlow`**: Manages everything related to the home screen, including navigation and specific interactions for this section.
- **`ProfileFlow`**: Exclusively deals with the user's profile section, handling its interactions and navigation in an isolated manner.

### Coordinators
- Each flow implements the `Coordinator` protocol, facilitating the management and control of the application's flow, ensuring smooth and logical transitions between screens and modules.

### Specialized Routers
- **`AppRouter`**: Focused on `AppFlow`, this router handles `AppTransition`, controlling transitions and navigation at the application level.
- **`HomeRouter`** and **`ProfileRouter`**: Dedicated routers for `HomeFlow` and `ProfileFlow`, respectively, each working with its own set of transitions (`HomeTransition` and `ProfileTransition`).

### Transitions
- Specific sets of transitions for each flow (such as `AppTransition`, `HomeTransition`, `ProfileTransition`) clearly define the possible routes and state changes within each section of the application.

## Getting Started

To collaborate on this project, follow these steps:

1. **Repository Cloning**: Clone the repository to your local development environment.
2. **Setup in Xcode**: Open the project in Xcode and configure the environment as needed.
4. **Initial Testing**: Compile and run the application to validate setup and basic functionality.

## Repository Structure

- `AppFlow.swift`: Central point for managing the main flow of the application.
- `HomeFlow.swift` and `ProfileFlow.swift`: Specific files for managing flows related to the home screen and profile, respectively.
- `Coordinator.swift`: Defines the general coordinator protocol.
- Routers: Specific router implementations (`AppRouter`, `HomeRouter`, `ProfileRouter`).
- Transitions: Definitions of transitions for each specific flow.

## Guide for Contributors
